# Unfamished
This (was supposed to be) a family chaos, sims style simulator game where your task is to survive the chaos of what your kids / family create, but I wasn't able to finish the game in time.  It is not quite playable and absolutely no game play done for it, yet the main idea and the art is done, so if you would like to spend some time to read through what my original plan was and maybe give some feedback (if that is even possible for this), then I would be very much happy to take this game further and actually complete the game to it's full extent. You can play a bit for yourself and see what I have got done.
